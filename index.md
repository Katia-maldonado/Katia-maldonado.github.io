### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 I liked because I got to learn how to calculate the unit
    price (the amount it cost per square inch) of pizza. I liked it even though
    it was an easy calculation that even I could calculate myself but we could
    see the calculations that the code outputted. In this lab it was the first
    time using multiplication and division operators.

Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.
