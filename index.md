## Computer Science 120 Labs

# Lab 3, Part 1 

I liked lab 3, part 1 because I got to learn how to calculate the unit price (the amount it cost per square inch) of pizza. I liked it even though it was an easy calculation that even I could calculate myself but we could see the calcultaions that the code outputted. In this lab it was the first time using multipication and division operators. 

# Lab 7, Part 2

I liked lab 7, part 2 because in this lab we used if statments to figure out when cars can and can not park on certain streets. If statements to me are interesting and I enjoy doing them but for this lab it was a struggle a little bit. The struggle was with how some of the signs had numerous days and exceptions that they could not park which made the if statement a bit more complicated. 

# Lab 8, Part 1

I liked lab 8, part 1 because for this lab we had to count the arguments for sandwiches. The code prompted to input their choice of protein, bread, and condiment. If there were not three arguments inputted then the user was prompted on the screen to input the three arguments again. I liked this lab because I like when we have to prompt the user with inputs.
