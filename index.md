### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1: I liked because I got to learn how to calculate the unit
    price (the amount it cost per square inch) of pizza. I liked it even though
    it was an easy calculation that even I could calculate myself but we could
    see the calculations that the code outputted. In this lab it was the first
    time using multiplication and division operators.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2: I liked because in this lab we used if statements to figure
    out when cars can and can not park on certain streets. If statments to me
    are intersting and I enjoy doing them but for this lab it was a struggle 
    a little bit. The struggle was with how some of the signs had numerous
    days and exceptions that they could not park which made the if statements
    a bit more complicated.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1: I liked because for this lab we had to count the arguments
    for sanwiches. The code prompted to input their choice of protein, bread,
    and condiment. If there were not three arguments inutted then the user was 
    prompted on the screen to input the three arguments again. I liked this lab 
    because I like when we have to prompt the user with inputs.
