### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1: I liked this lab because I got to learn how to calculate the unit
    price (the amount it cost per square inch) of pizza. I liked it even though
    it was an easy calculation that even I could calculate myself but we could
    see the calculations that the code outputted. In this lab it was the first
    time using multiplication and division operators. We prompted the user to
    input the cost and the diameter of the pizza and then after the code was
    ran then it gave the unit price. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2: I liked the second part of this lab because we used if
    statements to figure out when cars can and can not park on certain streets.
    If statments to me are intersting and I enjoy doing them but for this lab
    it was a struggle a little bit. The struggle was with how some of the signs
    had numerous days and exceptions that they could not park which made the
    if statements a bit more complicated. For some of the if statements we
    had to be specfic very specific with the minutes and hours and make sure
    the hours were in military time so the statement would work.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1: I liked this lab because we had to count the arguments
    for sandwiches. The code prompted to input their choice of protein, bread,
    and condiment. If there were not three arguments inutted then the user was 
    prompted on the screen to input the their three arguments again. I liked
    this lab because I like when we have to prompt the user with inputs. I also
    liked how at the end of the code we printed out the users choice of bread,
    protein, and condiments that they inputted.
